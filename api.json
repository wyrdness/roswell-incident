      "full": "The Roswell Incident is the most famous and controversial UFO event in history. On July 8, 1947, the Roswell Army Air Field issued a press release stating they had recovered a \\\"flying disc\\\" from a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. Within hours, the story was retracted and explained as a weather balloon. The incident was largely forgotten until the late 1970s when researchers began interviewing witnesses who claimed to have seen alien bodies and exotic debris with extraordinary properties. The U.S. government later explained the debris as part of Project Mogul, a classified balloon program designed to detect Soviet nuclear tests. Despite official explanations, the Roswell Incident remains the foundation of modern UFO culture and conspiracy theories about government cover-ups of extraterrestrial contact. Roswell has become the \\\"Alien Capital of the World\\\" and a cultural touchstone for UFO believers worldwide."
