      "summary": "The most famous UFO incident in history. In July 1947, debris was recovered from a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. Initially reported as a 'flying disc' by the Army, the story was quickly retracted as a weather balloon. Decades later, witnesses came forward claiming alien bodies and government cover-up.",
      "full": "The Roswell Incident is the most famous and controversial UFO event in history. On July 8, 1947, the Roswell Army Air Field issued a press release stating they had recovered a 'flying disc' from a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. Within hours, the story was retracted and explained as a weather balloon. The incident was largely forgotten until the late 1970s when researchers began interviewing witnesses who claimed to have seen alien bodies and exotic debris. The U.S. government later explained the debris as part of Project Mogul, a classified balloon program. Despite official explanations, the Roswell Incident remains the foundation of modern UFO culture and conspiracy theories about government cover-ups of extraterrestrial contact."
